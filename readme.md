#console and log print system

````console````
after requiring this package,when you use 'console.info' or 'console.debug' or 'console.warn' or 'console,error' in your project,the console could display as follows:
It contains printing time,log level and log info.Besides,special color with log level is necessary.

````log print system````
after required this,when you use 'logger.debug' or 'logger.info' or 'logger.warn' or 'console.error',the console shows the same style like the front introduction.Addition,the system will print the log to file which named server.log in current dirctory.And the content of server.log will be the same as what showing in console.

````others````
The test file is in current directory named logger_test,you can type 'node logger_test' which provides three types of case in current directory to check the correctness of function.
If you have any problem with the package,conact me with issue in github at any time.
